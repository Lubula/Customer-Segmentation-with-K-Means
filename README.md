# Various in depth Machine Learning Project:
1. This repository provides an in-depth analysis of customer segmentation using various clustering algorithms:

   1.1 Data Preparation
     - Load and preprocess the customer data.
   
   1.2 Normalization
     - Normalize the features to ensure equal contribution.
   
   1.3 Clustering Algorithms
     - K-Means Clustering
     - Hierarchical Clustering
     - DBSCAN
       
2. Build a Regression Model in Keras:
   
    2.A Build a baseline model
     - Use the Keras library to build a neural network with the following
    
    2.B Normalize the data
     - Repeat Part A but use a normalized version of the data
    
    2.C Increate the number of epochsC. Increate the number of epochs
     - Repeat Part B but use 100 epochs this time for training
    
    2.D Increase the number of hidden layers
     - Repeat part B but use a neural network with the following instead:
         - Three hidden layers, each of 10 nodes and ReLU activation function
      
3. Evaluating_and_Testing_Pre_trained_Models
building an image classifier using pre-trained models, namely ResNet50 and VGG16. Evaluating them as part of the training process, and then test them on a dedicated test set.

Assignment Task breakdown:

    - Build your code to design a classifier using VGG16 pre-trained model. 
    - Test both models, the one built using ResNet50 and VGG16, on a dedicated test set, which is provided to you in the Notebook.
    - Report performance of both models on the test set and generate some predictions as detailed in the Notebook.
